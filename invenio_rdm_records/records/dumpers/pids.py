    The JSON representation of the PIDs is a dictionary which keys
    are the identifier's scheme. However, that would turn into a dynamic
    mapping in ES with `text` type attributes. We want to be able to
    search by e.g. DOI in exact match terms. Since it contains dots, slashes,
    etc. it must be of type `keyword`. Therefore, this dumper turns the dict
    into a fixed mapping, dumping the key into the scheme attribute.
